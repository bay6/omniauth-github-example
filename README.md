##Why
When I tried to build a github omniauth login, I constantly saw the some outdated authenticate and omniauth example. https://github.com/pt/devise-omniauth-example.git
https://github.com/holden/devise-omniauth-example.git
So, I would like to build an example with the latest rails and authenticate without devise. (Probably add devise version later)
##What
This project will simply show how to use omniauth login github, currently rails 3.2

##How to use
```ruby
bundle
bundle exec rake db:migrate
rails s
```

## Demonstration of usage
